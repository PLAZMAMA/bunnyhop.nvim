## Installation

### Prerequisites

Curl and its cli are required as they are used for performing http requests to the different LLM providers.

Either Copilot(Recommenced) or Hugging Face's [Serverless](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/en/index).
- For Copilot, you only need to set it up via [copilot.lua](https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot.lua) or [copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim).
- For Hugging Face, an API key is required. Learn how to set it up [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/en/getting-started). Once you have the API key, create an enviornment variable for the key, eg. `export HF_API_KEY=************`.

### [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
    "PLAZMAMA/bunnyhop.nvim",
    lazy = false, -- This plugin does not support lazy loading for now
    -- Setting the keybinding for hopping to the predicted location.
    -- Change it to whatever suits you.
    keys = {
        {
            "<C-h>",
            function()
                require("bunnyhop").hop()
            end,
            desc = "[H]op to predicted location.",
        },
    },
    opts = {
        -- Currently the only options are "copilot" and "huggingface"
        adapter = "copilot",
        -- Model to use for chosen provider.
        -- To know what models are available for chosen adapter,
        -- run `:lua require("bunnyhop.adapters.{adapter}").get_models()`
        model = "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
        -- Copilot doesn't use the API key.
        --Hugging Face does and its stored in an enviornment variable.
        -- Example where `HF_API_KEY` is the name of the enviornment variable:
        -- `api_key = "HF_API_KEY"`
        api_key = "",
        -- Max width the preview window will be.
        -- Here for if you want to make the preview window bigger/smaller.
        max_prev_width = 20,
    },
},
```

## Configuration

Bunnyhop is configured via the setup() function. The default configuration values can be found [here](lua/bunnyhop/init.lua).

## Development

### Run tests


Running tests requires either

- [luarocks][luarocks]
- or [busted][busted] and [nlua][nlua]

to be installed[^1].
[^1]: The test suite assumes that `nlua` has
      been added to the PATH.

You can then run:

```bash
luarocks test --local
# or
busted
```

Or if you want to run a single test file:

```bash
luarocks test spec/path_to_file.lua --local
# or
busted spec/path_to_file.lua
```

### Common Errors

If you encounter the `module 'busted.runner' not found`
or `pl.path requires LuaFileSystem` errors, fix it by
runing the following command the following command:

```bash
eval $(luarocks path --no-bin)
```

If you encounter `sh: nlua: command not found` error the error above occurs do[^1]:

#### Linux/Mac

Run the following command:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.luarocks/bin
```

#### Windows

See the following guide to a variable to the PATH: [add to PATH][add-env-vars-windows].

> [!Note]
> For local testing to work you need to have Lua 5.1 set as your default version for
> luarocks. If that's not the case you can pass `--lua-version 5.1` to all the
> luarocks commands above, or set lua version 5.1 globally by running
> `luarocks config --scope system lua_version 5.1`.
